# Ubernator

This very sweet word (fusion of *Ubermost* and *generator*) is name of a website for generating customized wallpapers with letterings from [Ubermost](http://ubermost.com). This repository contains custom WordPress theme that the site is using.

Theme contains only few files because the site itself is not very complicated. It's basically one-pager with interactive UI to select lettering, color theme and size of the image. Generation of the image is done by AJAX request that as a response returns merged wallpaper. Thanks to great image manipulation library [Imagine](https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine), code is simple and clean.

I don't know what more to say, just go and [check out the site](http://make.ubermost.com) in action!
